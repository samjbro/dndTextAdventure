# dndTextAdventure
A series of attempts Dungeons & Dragons-inspired text adventure.
This is primarily a learning experience for me, although hopefully something playable might come out of it!
- v1: This version focuses on creating, saving and importing a party. There is also a mini-battle that may or may not be broken. 
    Run 'dnd.rb' to play.
- v2: This version focuses on navigation and exploration, and is fully playable, if a little limited.
    Run 'minigame.rb' to play.
- v3: In progress
